# FIJI-macro-ADA
This contains several ImageJ/FIJI macros used to quantify actin intensity on mitochondria in images/films of stained cells.

We have been studying a phenomenon we call Acute Damage-induced Actin, or ADA, in which we observe a buildup of actin around mitochondria when mitochondria are damaged. In our experiments, we have done a significant amount of cell imaging that we analyze using FIJI. To measure the actin intensity on mitochondria, we developed these macros.
